![photo_6267236052808875908_y](https://github.com/2003Madhuri/Movie/assets/109662506/44a7edac-dee0-4e10-8a48-98f02c3fd904)

This is a movie library web application that allows users to sign up, sign in, search for movies, and create lists of their favorite movies. Users can make these lists either public or private. The movie data is fetched from the OMDB API.


# Features:

The Registration Page requires users to provide their name, email, password, repeat password, and contact number to create an account. Once registered, users can navigate to the Login Page, where they can sign in using their username and password.

Upon successful login, users are directed to the Home Page, which features a navigation bar with options for searching movies, logging out, and displaying the username. The home page also includes an About Page with contact information and a footer with general site information and useful links.

The Search Page allows users to search for movies by title using a search box. When a user clicks on a movie poster, the application displays detailed information about the movie, including its name, rating, actors, and description. Users can manage their watchlist by clicking the bookmark button to add a movie or the trashcan button to remove it.
